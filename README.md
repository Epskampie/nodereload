# NodeReload

NodeReload is a simple alternative LiveReload implementation for Windows 7 using node.js. It allows you to use the LiveReload browser extensions without the LiveReload native program.

This is intended to be a temporary fix, until the LiveReload binaries for Windows are up to scratch.

## What it supports

* Triggering the browser reload on a file change, instantly.
* Live CSS reloading.

## What it doesn't support

* LESS, minifying, combining, or any other kind of processing of files.
